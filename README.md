# Spring Boot 'Hello World' application

## Introduction
This guide aims to instruct the beginners on how to create, build and run a Simple Java Web App based on Spring Boot framework.
Before we begin, I'd like to appreciate Mr. Marcin Wojtysiak's effort in creating [this amazing tutorial](https://github.com/martinwojtus/tutorials/tree/master/spring-boot/hello-world). Also, [here](https://frontbackend.com/spring-boot/your-first-spring-boot-application-hello-world) here you can find detailed instructions on how to use it.

## Containerizing the Application
Install `Docker Engine` if it is not installed yet.
Run `docker build`:
```
docker build -t spring-boot-helloworld:0.0.1 .
```

At this point the Application is built and ready to run. If you don't want to do a manual building - skip the next chapter.

## Running the Application on your Desktop

You may want to build the App manually and run it on your Desktop without containerizing it, also you may want to build a JAR archive and store it somewhere for later use. In this case please follow the instructions below in this chapter.

### Requirements

* Java Runtime Environment 8 to 11
* maven 3.3+

### Manual build and running

First, clone the repository:
```
https://github.com/andybondar/spring-boot-helloworld-example.git
```

Change directory to the `spring-boot-helloworld-example`, do whatever changes you need in the Java code, save them and then type:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Maven will build the Application and, if it succeeds, will start the Spring Boot:

```

### Building JAR archive
In the project's root folder run this:
```
mvn clean install
```
If it succeeds, you should be able to find `target/hello-world-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` in the `target` directory.

## Running the Application in a Kubernetes cluster
TBD

## Using CI to build and containerize the Application
### GitHub Actions
TBD

### Jenkins
TBD

### GitLab CI
TBD
